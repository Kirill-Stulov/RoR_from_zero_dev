# Lambda vs Proc

=begin
  If you�re thinking that procs and lambdas look super similar, that�s because they are! There are only two main differences.
  First, a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, 
  whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing.
  Second, when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.
  To see how this works, take a look at the code below. Our first method calls a proc; the second calls a lambda.
=end

def batman_ironman_proc
  victor = Proc.new { return "Batman will win!" }
  victor.call
  "Iron Man will win!"
end

puts batman_ironman_proc
puts '######'

def batman_ironman_lambda
  victor = lambda { return "Batman will win!" }
  victor.call
  "Iron Man will win!"
end

puts batman_ironman_lambda

# See how the proc says Batman will win? This is because it returns immediately, without going back to the batman_ironman_proc method.

# Our lambda, however, goes back into the method after being called, so the method returns the last code it evaluates: "Iron Man will win!"
